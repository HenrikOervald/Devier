            These "cookies" can be divided into 4 types each of which is outlined below. <br><br>
            
            Category 1: Strictly Necessary Cookies<br>

            more tailored and pleasant. The information is also merged with other users on an anonymous basis to enable us
            to improve how the site operates. For example our Saved Items feature utilizes a cookie to remember the products
            which you have expressed a wish to save whilst browsing our website.<br><br>
