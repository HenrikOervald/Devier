Specify pages by using their paths. Enter one path per line. The '*' character is a wildcard. Example paths are blog for the blog page and blog/* for every personal blog. <front> is the front page. If the PHP option is chosen, enter PHP code between <?php ?>. Note that executing incorrect PHP code can break your Drupal site.
